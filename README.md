>Please ensure you read the LICENSE document before using any release and pre-release files.

## CWC Overview:

### Core Logic:

The core functionality of CWC involves several steps to fetch and display weather data:

1. **API Key and Functions Importation:**
   Begin by including the necessary PHP files for the API key and functions.
   ```php
   require './path/to/example.php';
   include './path/to/example.php';
   ```

2. **Obtaining User Location:**
   Utilize [ipinfo.io](https://ipinfo.io/) to determine the user's IP address in the backend PHP code, and then use the [Google Maps Platform](https://mapsplatform.google.com/) to convert this IP into latitude and longitude coordinates.
   ```php
   function example() {
       $ip = $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'];
       $details = json_decode(file_get_contents("http://ipinfo.io/{$ip}/json"));
       return $details->city;
   }
   ```
   After the DOM is loaded, longitude and latitude are obtained through JavaScript location information. If permission is granted, the location information obtained through JavaScript will update the request.
   ```javascript
   var currentLocation = window.location.search;
   if (!currentLocation.includes("location=")) {
       if (navigator.geolocation) {
           var options = {
               enableHighAccuracy: example,
               timeout: example,
               maximumAge: example
           };
           navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(showPosition, showError, options);
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Setting Preferences via Cookies:**
   Confirm user preferences such as units and language by checking the JSON data stored in cookies.
   ```php
   if (isset($_POST['units'])) {
       $units = $_POST['units'];
       $cookieData = isset($_COOKIE['example']) ? json_decode($_COOKIE['example'], true) : array();
       $cookieData["units"] = $units;

       if (isset($_POST['setDefault'])) {
           $cookieExpiration = time() + (86400 * 90); // Setting cookie expiration
           $cookieData["example"] = date('Y-m-d H:i:s', $cookieExpiration);
           $jsonSettings = json_encode($cookieData);
           setcookie('example', $jsonSettings, $cookieExpiration, "/");
       }
   } else {
       if (isset($_COOKIE['example'])) {
           $cookieData = json_decode($_COOKIE['example'], true);
           $units = isset($cookieData['units']) ? $cookieData['units'] : "example";
       } else {
           $units = "example";
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Building the Request URL:**
   Construct the URL to request weather data, using various parameters such as location and units.
   ```php
   $weatherApiUrl = "https://api.example.com/weather/example/get?lat=40.4573&lon=-0.3425&lang=en&apikey=123456789&units=imperial";
   ```

5. **Processing Weather Data:**
   After making the request, verify the received weather data and prepare for display, including error handling and translating weather conditions into user-friendly descriptions.

6. **Displaying Weather Data:**
   Use PHP within HTML to display the weather data dynamically, styled with CSS for an appealing presentation.

### HTML & CSS Design:

CWC adopts a flat and minimalist design aesthetic, featuring right-angled borders, solid lines, and smooth transition animations for a clean and modern user interface.

```css
.cwc-btn {
    border-radius: 0px !important;
    border: 1px solid black;
    height: 36px;
    width: 297px;
    font-size: 14px;
    transition: background-color 0.3s, border-color 0.3s;
    background-color: transparent;
    color: black;
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    box-sizing: border-box;
    margin-bottom: 5px;
}
.cwc-btn:hover {
    background-color: black;
    color: white;
}
```
```html
<div>
    <span class="cwc-text-small">example: </span><br><strong class="cwc-head-daily"><?php echo $example['example'] * 100; ?></strong><strong>%</strong><br>
    <?php if (isset($example['example'])): ?>
    <div><span class="cwc-subhead"><strong>example: <?php echo $example['example']; ?> mm</strong></span></div>
    <?php endif; ?>
    <span class="cwc-text-small">example: <strong><?php echo $example['example']; ?>% ‚Ä¢ <?php echo getDescription($example['example']); ?></strong></span><br>
    <span class="cwc-text-small">example: <strong><?php echo $example['example']; ?> hPa ‚Ä¢ <?php echo getDescription($example['example']); ?></strong></span><br>
</div>

```
Interactive elements such as games are also integrated for a more engaging user experience.
```html
<iframe id="gameFrame" src="https://resource.caner.hk/get/game/dino/dino_with_title.html" height="200px" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen class="cwc-game"></iframe>
<button id="gameButton" class="cwc-btn">Play Chrome Dino for fun</button>
```
Control the display and closing of Game Iframe and the text switching of buttons through JavaScript code
```javascript
document.getElementById('gameButton').addEventListener('click', function() {
    var gameFrame = document.getElementById('gameFrame');
    var gameButton = document.getElementById('gameButton');

    if (gameFrame.style.maxHeight === '0px') {
        gameFrame.style.maxHeight = '200px';
        setTimeout(function() {
            gameFrame.style.opacity = '1';
        }, 500);
        gameButton.textContent = 'ÂÖ≥Èó≠ Chrome Dino Ê∏∏Êàè';
    } else {
        gameFrame.style.opacity = '0';
        setTimeout(function() {
            gameFrame.style.maxHeight = '0px';
        }, 500);
        gameButton.textContent = 'Áé© Chrome Dino Ê∂àÈÅ£‰∏Ä‰∏ã';
    }
});
```
