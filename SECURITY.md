Our project takes the security of its web application seriously. If you have discovered a security vulnerability, we encourage responsible disclosure to help us ensure the safety and privacy of our users.

Please adhere to the following guidelines when reporting a vulnerability:

1. **Confidentiality**: Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly before it has been addressed.
2. **Reporting Process**: Send a detailed report of the vulnerability to `connect@caner.hk`. Include steps to reproduce the vulnerability, any relevant screenshots, and additional information that can help us understand the scope and impact.
3. **Acknowledgment**: We will review your report and respond as quickly as possible. We appreciate your patience and cooperation during this process.
4. **Resolution**: Once we confirm the vulnerability, we will take appropriate measures to address it. We will keep you informed of our progress.

## Note on Website Updates

Our website is continuously updated to ensure it always runs the latest version, providing enhanced security and features. Users do not need to manually update; however, we encourage reporting any vulnerabilities found in the current version or in the Dev Research source code. These contributions are invaluable to us and help maintain the security and integrity of our web application.
